# Here we optimized a multi-purpose single-cell CRISPR platform for.
## Single-cell lineage tracking 
### We leveraged a self-mutating CRISPR system (e.g. homing CRISPR barcoded MARC1 mouse) to perform lineage tracking at single-cell resolution 
## Single-cell temporal recording 
### Here we developed a new metric called mutation density by utilizing the accumulative mutation pattern of homing CRISPR. 
## Single-cell CRISPR screen
### Here we use conventional (KO) vector libraries to perform single-cell CRISPR screen (Perturn-seq). 
#### Note that the single-cell CRISPR screen application is submitted as a separate manuscript.
